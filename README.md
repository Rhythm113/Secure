# Project Secure (Linux)    
By @Rhythm113     

A simple yet effective IDS to monitor your system. 

# Installation
 - Clone the repo to your server.
 - Run `sudo ./setup.sh`
 - Follow the setup process and enjoy !

# Setting up the Alert system
If you want to use the auto alert system (SMS or EMAIL) you can create your own API or use any 3rd party provider.
Just modify `send_alert()` inside `core.sh` to your needs.

Any type of contribution is appreciated :)
